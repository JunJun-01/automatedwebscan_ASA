The system architecture diagram presents a comprehensive overview of the projectâ€™s automated web attack surface analysis (ASA) system. The system is designed within a web application that allows users to input a target web URL and select the type of scans they wish to perform. The web interface is connected to a backend powered system by a Docker, which houses a variety of cybersecurity tools and scripts. The architecture is divided into two components, the web system and the docker server. The web system handles all user interactions like input validation, ethical user agreement, error handling, and displaying results. Once the user has provided the target URL and selected the scan type, it will run the specified scan script into the Docker Server. The docker server contains the core functionality of the automated ASA system. The scripts orchestrate the execution of various cybersecurity tools such as Nmap, Nikto, Uniscan, DNSmap, Wapiti, Wget, DavTest, Wafw00f, and Whatweb. Each tool performs specific security checks and vulnerability assessments on the target URL. Meanwhile, the system utilizes Kali Linux, a robust platform environment within the Docker container to run the scanning scripts on the selected tools. Once the scans are completed, the results are processed through a series of steps which includes vulnerability identification, prioritization, risk rating, remediation suggestions, all to generate the vulnerability report. Once the report is completed, it will be formatted into the web interface with an option for report installation. The architecture ensures a seamless flow from user input to comprehensive security analysis, making it an effective tool for automated web applications security assessment with customizable options enabled.
